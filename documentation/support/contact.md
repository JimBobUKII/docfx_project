DocFX is an API documentation generator for .NET, which currently supports C#, VB and F#. It generates API reference documentation from triple-slash comments in your source code. It also allows you to use Markdown files to create additional topics such as tutorials and how-tos, and to customize the generated reference documentation. DocFX builds a static HTML website from your source code and Markdown files, which can be easily hosted on any web server (for example, github.io). Also, DocFX provides you the flexibility to customize the layout and style of your website through templates.
